disappeared for a while
work for some big scale projects
realize the importance of using docker

So why docker?
- The purpose of using docker
- comparing docker with VMs
quote:
Itâ€™s important to distinguish containers and hypervisor-based virtual machines (VMs). VMs allow multiple copies of the operating system, or even multiple different operating systems, to share a machine. Each VM can host and run multiple applications. By comparison, a container is designed to virtualize a single application, and all containers deployed on a host share a single OS kernel, as Figure 2 shows. Typically, containers spin up faster, run the application with bare-metal performance, and are simpler to manage since there is no additional overhead to making an OS kernel call.

- the weakness of docker when dealing with GPUs -> nvidia-docker

Installation of docker
nvidia-driver in host
install docker
install nvidia-docker

Examples

Hey guys, it has been quite a long while since my last blog post (for almost a year, I guess). Today, I am going to tell you about something that I wish I had known before: nvidia-docker.
